<p class="admin-text-style">Here you will find detail and updated information on all of your shuttle drivers. You'll be able to use their car information to grab real-time and accurate information on both their driving etiquecy and efficiency. But instead of having you regularly
    check the status of all your drivers, there's an implemented auto-notification feature that can alert any drivers that may be going astray. Should they choose to ignore the notification, all admins assigned to them will be alerted that they've ignored
    their notification warning. </p>

<p class="admin-text-style">Our goal was to not only help promote taking cars off the streets while leading tourists and locals to the great public system this city has to offer, but to also keep our streets safer with great leading shuttle drivers. With our integrated notification
    system, and access to the user-friendly data provided by LA's great public services, we hope to make LA streets a safer and more efficient.
